Structured light 3D scanning using multiple frequency phase shifting. Written in Java.

This project is divided into separate subprojects, each setup as a netbeans project. They use an XML configuration to read and write data in another "data directory". 

Why is there a date in the repo name?
This project is one of several iterations I have developed over the years. I am posting here as a code sample. In the future, my goal is to eventually combine these iterations to a unified code base for structured light.
